# My Vue App

Welcome to the README for my brand new Vue app!

## Why did I create this app?

There are several reasons why I decided to create a brand new Vue app:

1. **Learning and Experimentation**: I wanted to learn more about Vue.js and get hands-on experience with this popular JavaScript framework. Creating a new app from scratch allowed me to experiment with different features and concepts.

2. **Portfolio Project**: I wanted to have a project that I could showcase in my portfolio. Building a Vue app gave me the opportunity to demonstrate my skills and understanding of modern web development practices.

3. **Personal Use**: I had a specific use case or idea in mind that I wanted to bring to life. Creating a new app allowed me to tailor the functionality and design to my exact needs and preferences.

## Why did I host it on Netlify?

I chose to host my Vue app on Netlify for several reasons:

1. **Ease of Deployment**: Netlify makes it incredibly easy to deploy a web app. I simply connected my GitHub repository, and Netlify took care of the rest.

2. **Continuous Deployment**: Netlify offers continuous deployment, which means that every time I push changes to my repository, my app is automatically redeployed.

3. **Serverless Functions**: Netlify provides serverless functions, which allowed me to add backend functionality to my app without the need for a traditional server.

4. **Performance**: Netlify offers features like automatic optimization of images and server-side rendering, which can help improve the performance of my app.

5. **Free Plan**: Netlify offers a generous free plan that provides everything I need to get started with hosting my app.

## Conclusion

In summary, I created this Vue app to learn, showcase my skills, and fulfill a specific need. Hosting it on Netlify was a natural choice given the ease of deployment, continuous deployment, serverless functions, performance improvements, and the availability of a free plan. It was an intentional decision to use these technologies to create and host my app, and I'm excited to continue learning and building with them!
